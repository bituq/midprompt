# Midprompt

Hello there! Welcome to Midprompt. This is little tool that helps you generate Midjourney prompts by utilizing the latest and greatest GPT-4. Midjourney is a generative artificial intelligence program that generates images from natural language descriptions.

## So, what can we do?

Set the creativity for your AI by setting the "temperature" of the model in the settings. You also can tweak several preset parameters such as:

- Who the depictive artist is
- Camera settings 
- Color palettes 
- Artistic style (Monet? Caravaggio? You choose!)
- Mood settings 
- Subject matter
- Lighting conditions
- Year of creation 
- Perspective 
- Artwork title 
- Choice of materials 
- And loads more besides!

If you leave any of these blank, we'll fill in the gaps for you, just like a creative brainstorming session!

## But what's under the hood?

It's built with Vue3 and TypeScript. The UI was crafted with Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI for a (hopefully) stylish, clean look.

## How can I start using it?

First off, you're going to need your OpenAI API key. Then launch the application, plug the API key into the index page, and you're all set to go!

## Running the Application Locally 

1. To start off, you will need to clone the repo to your local machine. Run this on your command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bituq/midprompt
cd midprompt
```

2. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. You can now run the server on your localhost:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Your app will be up and running on `http://localhost:8080`. Open it in your browser and start exploring!
